# FAQ-Component
This is a website in which I have exersized with the following things: 

- Converting HTML to a Component
- Use EventListeners to fold the FAQ component in and out
- Create a array
- Use a for-loop
- Looping into the array
- Generate multiple components based on array data
- Use classList toggle

The website is of course written in JavaScript but lastly there is also HTML and CSS used for creating this website.
